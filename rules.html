        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>You want to end up with the least number of points.</p>
        <h2>Set Up</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone starts the game with four cards.
            <br>
            You get to look at two of your cards.
        </p>
        <h2>Points</h2>
        <p>Cards are worth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Red Kings: -1</li>
            <li>Jokers: 0</li>
            <li>Aces: 1</li>
            <li>2s: 2</li>
            <li>3s: 3</li>
            <li>4s: 4</li>
            <li>5s: 5</li>
            <li>6s: 6</li>
            <li>7s: 7</li>
            <li>8s: 8</li>
            <li>9s: 9</li>
            <li>10s: 10</li>
            <li>Jacks: 10</li>
            <li>Queens: 10</li>
            <li>Black Kings: 13</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Powers</h2>
        <p>
            When you draw cards, you can sometimes place them immediately in the discard pile to take a special 
            action.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>7s and 8s: Look at 1 of your cards</li>
            <li>9s and 10s: Look at 1 of another players cards</li>
            <li>Jacks and Queens: Switch 1 of your cards with 1 of another players cards</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Additionally, you can tap the discard pile to get rid of cards.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can tap it if it matches one of your cards. You can add it to the discard pile.</li>
            <li>
                You can tap it if it matches another players card. You add their card to the discard pile 
                and replace it with one of your cards.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Only one person can tap each card in the discard pile. If you are wrong, you must add another 
            card to your hands. You cannot look at this card.
        </p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            Players take turns drawing cards. They can exchange it with one of their cards or discard the 
            card. If the card has any powers and they discard it, they get to choose whether or not to use the
            power. Players can tap the discard pile at any time if the card hasn't already been tapped by
            another player.
        </p>
        <h2>End</h2>
        <p>
            When a player thinks they have won, they call Cabo instead of taking a turn. Every other player
            gets one more turn, then all cards are flipped over. Whoever has the least points wins.
