            The goal of the game is to have the least number of points. Number cards are worth their number, aces are 1, jacks and queens 10, 
            red kings -1, black kings 13, and jokers 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            All players start with 4 cards. They get to choose 2 of those cards to look at, the others will remain unknown. On a player's
            turn, they draw the top card from the draw pile and look at it. They can decide to switch it with one of their cards or discard
            it.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you discard a 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, or queen after drawing it, you can do something special. With a 7 or 8, you get to look at
            1 of your cards. With a 9 or 10, you get to look at 1 card from another player. With a jack or queen, you can switch 1 of your
            cards with another person's card, but you cannot look at either.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, you can slap (click) the discard pile to get rid of cards. You have 2 options. First, if you have a card that
            is the same number or face card, you can flip it over and add it to the discard pile. If you are wrong, you must add another 
            card to your hand from the top of the draw pile, without seeing it. Second, if you know another player's card, you can flip
            their card over, then replacing it with a card from your hand. If wrong, the same thing happens as if you tried to get rid
            of one of your cards. Two or more players can not slap the same card.
        </p>
        <p>
            To end the game, a player will call Cabo instead of drawing a card from the draw pile. Once they do that, every other player
            gets one more turn. Then, every player will flip over their cards and count their points. The player with the least points
            wins.
